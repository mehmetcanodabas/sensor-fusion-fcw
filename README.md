Implementation of Multi-Sensor Data Fusion for a Forward Collision Warning (FCW) System

This project was carried out at the Multisensorial Systems Laboratory, Chair of Communications Engineering, TU Chemnitz, as part of practical training.

Since the source code belongs to the institution, it cannot be shared publicly.  

This repository only contains the architecture summary, methodology, and overall design documentation.

### Important information
This project does not implement the entire forward collision warning system from scratch. Instead, a BASELABS data fusion framework was provided with placeholder functions. The main task was to derive and implement the mathematical and physical models. These models define how the sensors perceive objects and how the state evolves. Once completed, the provided framework could run and automatically calculate the time-to-collision.

**⚠️[Project summary (Pdf)](docs/project-summary.pdf): Detailed description of implemented sensor models and their integration into the BASELABS framework for is provided in this PDF.**
